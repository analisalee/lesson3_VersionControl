            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Versioning Control System (VCS) is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of the program or software. It automatically notes: who changed the files (revision history), when they were changed, what about them is new or different, and merges changes to the same file. This is very helpful when you are working in a team because it can assign induvial files to each person so they can work on it separately. And when they are done it has the tools to merge them all together into the main file again. The VCS is very efficient and that is why it is an important skill to have on my resume. This topic interests me because if it helps me be more marketable to employers then I want to know it.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a helpful tool to help us manage files. Instead of saving files of history like most VSC tools, git takes screenshots of the file when change has been applied. One advantage of git is to help keep track of the history of a file. It is useful to have just a screenshot of when a file is changed because it is easy to keep track of. Another advantage is when you use it to collaborate with others. Instead of coming together at the end of a project to join all other files – you can just share screenshots periodically to remain on the same page about things. I find this interesting because I think it is a useful tool to know in the future to help me work on projects.

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two types of repositories that can be created. One being the Remotes Repository, which resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team leaders. A key thing to remember about the remote repository is that it can be shared. An example of a remote repository would be Github. This is useful to share among a team to program a file and push to the main repository. I find this interesting because it gives me a deeper knowledge on how to more efficiently share my work and further my career in the IT world. I think it is a good thing to understand the details of how Github works so we can sound intelligent to employers.

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The other type of repository is the Local Repository. This repository resides on a local machine of an induvial user. An example of this would be Cloud9. The local repository is essentially as basic as it sounds – it is what users use to pull files from the main repository to edit on their own device. The key word to associate with this repository is create! There is two ways to create a local repository: create a brand new repository, or clone an existing remote repository on your device. I find this interesting because it explains why we use Cloud9 for our assignments.

                <span class="text-muted">Basic Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are quite a few different commands for GIT but the basic ones are: add, commit, and push. These help us add files, commit them to memory and then push them to the main repository. You must declare the files that were changed to be added first. Then, you must commit the changes to the repository to store in memory. Lastly, you must push the changes in the local repo to the remote repo. There is also one step you must do before the first 3, which is to create a local repo. You do this by using the command: git init.This is interesting because it breaks down the steps and commands needed to utilize the GIT features and both repositories.
